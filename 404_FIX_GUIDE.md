# 🚨 404 Error Fix - GitHub Pages Not Working

## Current Issue
Your GitHub Actions deployment is successful (✅), but `kasuniga.github.io/My_Portfolio/` shows a 404 error.

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/KasuniGA/My_Portfolio`
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Pages"** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **"Source"**, it should say **"GitHub Actions"**
5. If it doesn't, select **"GitHub Actions"** and click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Repository Name
Make sure your repository is actually named `My_Portfolio` (check the URL in your browser)

### Step 3: Force a New Deployment
1. Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your repository
2. Click on **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button (if available)
4. Or make a small change to your code and push to trigger a new deployment

### Step 4: Check Build Output
After the updated workflow runs, check the logs for the "List build output (debug)" step to see if files are being built correctly.

## 🕐 Wait Time
GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update after deployment. If you just pushed changes, wait a few minutes and try again.

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Repository Name Mismatch
**Solution**: Make sure your repository name exactly matches what's in `vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/My_Portfolio/' : '/',
```

### Issue 2: GitHub Pages Not Enabled
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Select "GitHub Actions" as source
3. Save settings

### Issue 3: Build Output Location Wrong
**Solution**: The updated workflow will show debug information about where files are being built.

## 🚀 Quick Test
After making these changes, try:
1. Push a small change to your repository
2. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
3. Check `https://kasuniga.github.io/My_Portfolio/` again

## 📞 If Still Not Working
If the issue persists:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for any errors
2. Verify the repository name is exactly `My_Portfolio`
3. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
4. Try accessing `https://kasuniga.github.io/My_Portfolio/index.html` directly

## 🎯 Expected URL
Your site should be available at: `https://kasuniga.github.io/My_Portfolio/`

**Next Steps**: Push the updated workflow and check the debug output to see what's happening with the build process.
