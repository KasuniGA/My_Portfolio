# üö® Repository Name Change - Update Guide

## Your Situation

You've already deployed your portfolio with a previous repository name, but now you want to use the repository name `My_Portfolio` with the URL `https://KasuniGA.github.io/My_Portfolio/`.

## üîß Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Update Your Existing Repository (Recommended)

If you want to keep your existing repository but change the name:

1. **Rename your existing repository**:

   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings"
   - Scroll down to "Repository name"
   - Change it to `My_Portfolio`
   - Click "Rename"

2. **Update your local repository**:

   ```bash
   cd "e:\KasuniPortfolio\KasuniPortfolio"
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/KasuniGA/My_Portfolio.git
   ```

3. **Push the updated configuration**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update repository name to My_Portfolio"
   git push
   ```

### Option 2: Create a New Repository

If you want to start fresh:

1. **Create a new repository** named `My_Portfolio`
2. **Push your code** to the new repository:
   ```bash
   cd "e:\KasuniPortfolio\KasuniPortfolio"
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/KasuniGA/My_Portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Keep Current Repository Name

If you want to keep your current repository name, you need to:

1. **Update `vite.config.ts`** to match your current repository name:

   ```typescript
   base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/YOUR_CURRENT_REPO_NAME/' : '/',
   ```

2. **Update all documentation** to reflect the correct URL

## ‚úÖ After Making Changes

Regardless of which option you choose:

1. **Wait for GitHub Actions to complete** (check the "Actions" tab)
2. **GitHub Pages will automatically update** with the new configuration
3. **Your site will be available** at the correct URL within 5-10 minutes

## üîç How to Check Current Status

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" ‚Üí "Pages"
3. You'll see your current GitHub Pages URL
4. Check the "Actions" tab to see if any workflows are running

## üöÄ What Happens Next

- If you renamed the repository, your old URL will automatically redirect to the new one
- GitHub Actions will rebuild and redeploy your site
- The new URL will be active within a few minutes

## üí° Pro Tip

I recommend **Option 1** (renaming your existing repository) because:

- It's the simplest solution
- Preserves your commit history
- GitHub automatically handles URL redirects
- No need to reconfigure GitHub Pages settings
