# 📧 Direct Contact Form Setup with Formspree

## Current Implementation

I've updated your contact form to use **Formspree**, which allows direct form submission from GitHub Pages without requiring server-side code.

## 🚀 How to Set Up Formspree (Required)

### Step 1: Create Formspree Account

1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create a New Form

1. Click "New Form" in your Formspree dashboard
2. **Form Name**: Portfolio Contact Form
3. **Email**: kasuniabeynayake01@gmail.com (your email)
4. Click "Create Form"

### Step 3: Get Your Form Endpoint

1. After creating the form, you'll see a form endpoint like:
   ```
   https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
   ```
2. Copy this endpoint

### Step 4: Update the Contact Component

1. Open `client/src/components/Contact.tsx`
2. Find this line:
   ```typescript
   const formspreeEndpoint = "https://formspree.io/f/xdkoqokp";
   ```
3. Replace `xdkoqokp` with your actual Formspree form ID

### Step 5: Configure Form Settings (Optional)

In your Formspree dashboard, you can:

- Set up custom reply messages
- Add spam protection
- Configure email notifications
- Set up form redirects

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User fills out form** on your website
2. **Form submits directly** to Formspree
3. **Formspree forwards email** to kasuniabeynayake01@gmail.com
4. **You receive notification** in your inbox
5. **User sees success message** on your website

## ✅ Benefits

- ✅ **Direct submission** - no email client needed
- ✅ **Spam protection** - built-in filtering
- ✅ **Free tier** - 50 submissions/month
- ✅ **No backend required** - perfect for GitHub Pages
- ✅ **Reliable delivery** - professional email service

## 🔧 Free Tier Limits

For higher volume, Formspree has paid plans starting at $10/month.

## 🛡️ Fallback Method

The form includes a fallback mechanism:

- If Formspree fails, it automatically opens the user's email client
- This ensures messages can always be sent

## 📝 Testing

After setup:

1. Deploy your changes to GitHub Pages
2. Fill out the contact form on your website
3. Check your email for the message
4. Verify the success message appears

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Replace the form endpoint** with your actual Formspree form ID
- **Test thoroughly** before sharing your portfolio
- **Monitor your Formspree dashboard** for submissions
- **Consider upgrading** if you exceed free tier limits

## 🎉 Once Set Up

This is the most reliable solution for contact forms on GitHub Pages!
